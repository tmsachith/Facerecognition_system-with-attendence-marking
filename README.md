# Smart Attendance System 🎓📸

An AI-powered Face Recognition Attendance System built with **Python**, **Flask**, **OpenCV**, and **face_recognition** library.  
This system captures faces in real time, marks attendance, and provides a web dashboard for live monitoring, attendance reports, and student registration.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Real-time face recognition using webcam.
- Auto attendance marking with timestamp and date.
- Web-based dashboard built with Flask for:
  - Live camera feed & attendance logging.
  - Student registration (via photo upload or webcam capture).
  - Attendance records viewing.
  - Attendance report generation for date ranges.
- Attendance stored in daily CSV files.
- Beautiful UI with responsive design.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ✅ Example dependencies:
```
flask
opencv-python
face_recognition
numpy
pandas
```

### 4. Run the application
```bash
python imagerec.py
```

### 5. Access the dashboard
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🎥 How It Works
1. Start the camera from the dashboard.
2. The system recognizes registered faces and marks attendance.
3. View real-time logs and attendance data on the dashboard.
4. Register new students by uploading a photo or capturing from webcam.
5. Generate attendance reports by selecting date ranges.

## ✅ Deployment Suggestions
- Can be deployed on a local PC or Raspberry Pi for LAN use.
- Optionally run on an internal server and access from other devices using local IP.
- For cloud hosting, webcam features will require modification to accept browser-based uploads.
